# === Signal thresholds (used by ETL/41_signals_with_peer.py and others) ===
thresholds:
  # Minimum absolute export value (USD) for considering a YoY change - VERY PERMISSIVE
  MIN_EXPORT_USD: 10000
  # Minimum partner total imports (USD) for considering a peer-gap signal - VERY PERMISSIVE  
  MIN_IMPORT_USD: 500000
  # Peer gap: require at least this absolute gap vs peer median (in fraction points, 0.01 = 1pp) - VERY PERMISSIVE
  S1_REL_GAP_MIN: 0.001
  # YoY % threshold for absolute exports (0.05 = 5%) - VERY PERMISSIVE
  S2_YOY_THRESHOLD: 0.05
  # YoY % threshold for partner share inside CZ exports (0.05 = 5%) - VERY PERMISSIVE
  S3_YOY_SHARE_THRESHOLD: 0.05
  # Max signals returned in total and per type - GENERATE MANY MORE
  MAX_TOTAL: 5000
  MAX_PER_TYPE: 2000
